    "description": "Bilastine is a potent, effective, non-sedating, long-acting histamine antagonist with selective & high affinity to H1 receptor (3 times higher than Cetirizine and 5 times higher than Fexofenadine). Even at a high concentration, Bilastine does not show affinity for the 30 other receptors including muscarinic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors, for the other histamine receptor subtypes (H2, H3 and H4). It shows excellent safety profile and very favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics. Bilastine doesnâ€™t undergo any metabolism to be active. Bilastine is excreted by feces (non-systemic) & urine (systemic) approximately 66.35% & 28.31% respectively."
